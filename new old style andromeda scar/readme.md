Meant to fit the Gen4 Andromeda BCAR by EliWu, available here from Roboman: https://roboman.net/products/andromeda-bcar-kit

This print needs tree supports and a brim. Recommended to print at 100% infill 5 walls.

This shroud is modeled off of the original Andromeda Gen1 shroud, reverse engineered via screenshots of old youtube videos from EliWu. He says its quite close to the original!
